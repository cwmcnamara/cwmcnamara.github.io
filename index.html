        <h2>My Shot, My Goal</h2>
        <p>Alot of things make up a person, the same can be said about most things. I am not the rose that grew from the concrete.
          But I am the railroad spike that would not be nailed down. I am the voice that can not be quieted even when everyone else
          remains silent. I am determined to change the world. I believe that I have the skills necessary to invent revolutionary technologies
          or to spread messages of change that ripple through every country. What skills do I have then? I am a programmer, a developer.
          I have all the ideas and I can write code efficiently and effectively so now I just need the education to help me connect the
          dots. I said that I am not the rose that grew from the concrete, but I will make sure that those who are the roses bloom and that we
          celebrate their tenacity.</p>

              <h2>Early Works</h2>
              <p>Initially I was not even moderately interested in computer science. At the beginning of my tenth grade year at Collegiate Academy I had a web design class
                that wasn't even a little helpful. The teacher played on his phone and left us to our own devices, I worked through it and while it was certainly not my best
                experience, It wasn't my worst. In that time I designed probably ten to twenty simple webpages. My junior year at Erie High School proved to be better
                in terms of my interest in programming. At the time I was very interested in game design and joined the class "Intro to Computer Science". Initally we worked on
                designing webpages, which I became proficient at due to my previous limited experience. The teacher for the class was Jordan Lander who pushed me to go farther
                when he saw me taking a lead and going ahead. A few weeks into the quarter I finished the entire curriculum for that course and moved on to another course called
                "Computer Science Principles" which was also simple and I finished in days. Following this I came to my most impressive accomplishment in which to aid in my work on
                a project, I navigated through the entire advanced design course in a week and better than that I finished AP Computer Science in three weeks and as of the year of writing
                this webpage I have now recieved credit for my work. I became obsessed with programming and design through these endeavors.

              <h2>Project Vibe</h2>
              <p><i>Project Vibe</i> was built for the sole intention of helping people. Unfortunately it never came to fruition for better or worse and it is now unfunded.
              This category is designated for web design but I believe it's important to look at what <i>Project Vibe</i> started as. <i>Project Vibe</i> started as a
              JavaScript based app built on code.org. It then moved to a Squarespace webpage with embedded code rather than just straight design. Having said what the website and
              the app were made of, what is more important is what they aimed to accomplish.</p>
              <p><i>Project Vibe</i> was a project I started for the Pennsylvania Governer's Invention Competition. It was an attempt to educate and inform people, especially
              teens, about mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and eating disorders among many others. The website and the app featured surveys that allowed users
              not to self-diagnose necessarily, but to identify symptoms tied to particular mental disorders. I started building the app on my own and by the time I had recruited Desiree
              Adams, Justice Wickham, and Kristina Wagner to assist in the project, I had finished the app itself with over 2500 lines of JavaScript and though the methods weren't extraordinarily
              advanced, the process was a good introduction to programming in particular, but also design in a minor way. We introduced the app to the competition as a compilation of related
              information to mental disorders

              <h2>BR3: Royal Rewards Program</h2>
              <p>The <i>BR3: Royal Rewards Program</i> was a failure in all aspects. One should never be afraid to admit failures when they come around and there's no other word
                for what happened. I was recruited at the end of my Junior year to work over the summer on a rewards program for Erie High School to incentivize students to behave in exchange
                for a sort of rewards system, after all Erie High School has been notorious in the past three years of its existence for having students who are habitually truant, violent
                and just all around rude (The school exprienced some mild reform this past year). The website was never even uploaded and I realized that I was no "Genius" when it came to
                web design and the internet can't teach you everything. That being said, the website was fully structured though never fully functional when it was shut down my the new Administrator
                over the school along with some high ranking educators for fear that it would give me too much power. Concerns noted, I shut down development.</p>
              <p>Despite some obvious shortcomings The <i>BR3: Royal Rewards Program</i> actually holds a very special place in my heart. It did several things to me. Most importantly, I don't know
                everything and even though the internet can teach you alot of things, it can't teach you everything hence why I will be attending Cleveland State University in the fall.
                Another important teaching moment in this experience is that the idea and the motivation are far more important than the execution. I want good things for Erie High School,
                and so I hoped we could initiate a rewards system in which you could earn points that would be uploaded to your phone and you could use these to order items from the school store
                among many other ideas that I hoped to make a reality.

              <h2>CMCN Exoplanetary Catalog</h2>
              <p>I love space. To be less eloquent for a moment, space is awesome. In my opinion, the easiest things to understand about space and certainly some of the most
              interesting are exoplanets. Exoplanets are planets that are outside our solar system but by definition must orbit a star.</p>
